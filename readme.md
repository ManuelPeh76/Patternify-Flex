# About the recLog file *.rec

###### The Rec data parent element ('recLog') is an array. This array consists of three child arrays:

```sh
recLog = [a: record number][b: item number][c: [item]]

recLog[a][b]    = [delay, mode, [item]]
recLog[a][b][0] = delay,     // in milliseconds
recLog[a][b][1] = mode,      // explained below
recLog[a][b][2] = [property (, property2 (, property3)...)]
```

###### An example in JSON notation (the format of the recorded files):

```sh
recLog = [                                  <-- record array
           [                                <-- items array
             [0,0,[matrix]],                <-- all records start with a header,
                                                consisting of a delay of 0,
                                                item number 0 and a starting matrix
             [100,1,[0,0,1]],               <-- wait 100ms,
                                                then draw Pixel at x/y coordinate 0/0
             [100,4,[18,10,0,1,null,null]], <-- wait 100ms, then call the line tool(4)
                                                and set the starting point for the
                                                erasing line at x/y coordinate 18/10

            Delay      Finish     Fill
            EndX and EndY === NULL means this is the start of the item
            ]

##### HTTP_GET Variables or HASH

The tool comes with some GET / HASH variables, to call it with a preconfigurated size or matrix.

Available variables are:

* idleTime
* width
* height
* xcursor
* ycursor
* size
* cursors
* matrix
* color
* destroybackup
* destroykeys

#### Examples
```sh
idleTime=3000               <- Delay after minimizing, before hidden eyes wake up
width=32                    <- Width of the grid
height=32                   <- Height of the grid
xcursor=10                  <- Use only the first 10 pixels per row
ycursor=10                  <- Use only the first 10 pixels per column
size=[width, height]        <- Shortcut to set width and height
cursors=[x,y]               <- shortcut to set x and y limiter
color={r:255,g:255,b:0,a:1} <- Preselect draw color and opacity
destroybackup=1             <- Remove backup from the LocalStorage
destroykeys=1               <- Remove custom keybindings from LocalStorage
matrix={matrix:[matrix],... <- Sets the whole pattern

...so you could do this...
  .../index.html?width=32&height=32                         Start up with a 32x32 pixels grid.
  .../index.html?xcursor=16&ycursor=16                      Set x and y limiter to 16x16 pixels.
  .../index.html?width=32&height=32&xcursor=16&ycursor=16   Combines the last described.
  .../index.html?size=[32,32]&cursors=[16,16]               Does the same as before, a shorter notation.
```

#### Matrix-Example

This shows a 10x10 pixel grid, limiters set
    to 8x8 pixel, holding a 5x5 pixel matrix,
    which shows a black border (1 pixel wide) with a transparent filling
```sh
matrix={
 [
  [[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1]],
  [[255,255,255,1],0,0,0,[255,255,255,1]],
  [[255,255,255,1],0,0,0,[255,255,255,1]],
  [[255,255,255,1],0,0,0,[255,255,255,1]],
  [[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1],[255,255,255,1]]
 ],
 pixelsX:10,
 pixelsY:10,
 xcursor:8,
 ycursor:8
}

Of course this is written in one line in the url, avoiding spaces, as a _GET variable.
```
